# TakeTwo

## Description

The first two weeks is an extremely important time to get new students acquainted with RCOS, old students updated on any changes in structure/leadership, assigning mentors and a handful of other tasks. This is the most important time for the Coordinators to be "on top of things".

## Getting Started
Prior to the first meeting, mentors and new Coordinators should be chosen. Any planned changes should be reflected in the relevant documentation and/or presentations. The Coordinators should meet to plan and make sure all administrative affairs are in order.

In addition, at least one [mentor training session](mentoring/training) must take place prior to the first meeting.
