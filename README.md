# Hacktoberfest
Handbook for Call for Code for Racial Justice Hacktober Projects


## Prerequisites

- `Node.js`

    Version 14.x is the current LTS (2021-09-29)

- `npm`

## Run locally

1. Clone the repo.

2. It is recommended to install docsify-cli globally, which helps initializing and previewing the website locally.
    ```
    npm i docsify-cli -g
    ```

    You can also use docsify without installing it globally, later on, with `npx docsify <command>`.

3. Preview the site

    ```
    docsify serve docs
    ```

    Without docsify globally installed, use `npx docsify serve docs`.

4. You can preview your site in your browser on `http://localhost:3000`
